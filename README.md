# AI_WaterStageDischarge

Work elaborated with the University of Nebraska Lincoln to predict stage and discharge values from a river with cameras, image processing and machine learning.

Our work is based on the previos project of the university trying to find better results or alternative solutions.

We went down four roads: Implementing different regression models, training models with sesonal data, implementing time series for predicction and image recognition models.

All implementations and evidence is locate in this repository, including the results report for our work.
